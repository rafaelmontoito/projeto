    <h3>Hello There!</h3>
    <p>My name is Rafael Montoito, I’m a 21 year old student at the Fine-Arts Faculty of the University of Lisbon. I’m a communicaton and UX designer currently taking a post graduate course on Digital Experience Design. But my Interest in graphic design has grown through the years, firstly during my time studying art in high school and more recently throughout by BA. I’ve developed a set of skills, during the past 3 years that range from conceptual thinking to practical skills such as fluency in digital tools.</p>
